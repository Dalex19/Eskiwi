# Eskiwi_app

It is a purely educational project and personal practice, in which I do not intend to profit from it. Its original author is DalasReview: https://x.com/DalasReview/status/1809220764467335457

This is what I have created: https://x.com/AleFC98/status/1811862924673077601 , which is purely ui, from the images of the official eskiwi publication.
